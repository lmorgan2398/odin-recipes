# odin-recipes

This will be my first project for The Odin Project. I will be demonstrating my command of basic HTML writing skills, including: HTML boilerplate, text-based elements, image elements, and hypertext-linked elements. Furthermore, my newly developed skills in using basic CLI controls and using Git to upload my work to GitHub will be put to use in 
creating the workspace for the project and uploading it to the appropriate repository.
