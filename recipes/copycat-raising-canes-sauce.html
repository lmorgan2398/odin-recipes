        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Skip the drive-thru--you already have everything you need to make fast food's greatest dipping sauce.</p>
        <p>Raising Cane's is a Louisiana-based fast food chain that's gained immense popularity in the last
             decade, largely because of two things: Its beloved chicken fingers and its signature sauce, dubbed 
             Cane's sauce. Cane's sauce has a devoted following all on its own, with some fans even saying they'd 
             go so far as to drink the stuff. The chain doesn't sell bottles of Cane's sauce (yet, at least), but 
             you can order large quantities on the side--up to a 32-ounce cup.
        </p>
        <p>While the chain has expanded significantly over the last few years, you may still be waiting on 
             Raising Cane's to open near you. Whether you're in that camp or are a longtime fan of Cane's 
             sauce, this copycat recipe tastes just like the real thing (and costs way less than the drive-thru). 
             Here's how to make Copycat Cane's Sauce at home with simple pantry staples you probably already have 
             on hand.
